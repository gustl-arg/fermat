#Contributing Guide (for developers)

<br>

Fermat is a community driven open source project, so you are welcome to contribute! +

## Developers
=======

Just choose one of the possibilities we have come up with in our [Contribution Program](https://github.com/bitDubai/contribution-program/blob/master/README.md) or contact us to propose your own [here](https://bitdubai.com/wp/#GETINVOLVED)

If you have a Developer Team (or can easily gather one) you will probably like to get an assigned task in our development program to get the corresponding bounty. Please visit our [Bounty Program](https://github.com/bitDubai/bounty-program/blob/master/README.md). 

If you are interested in a rewarded part-time collaboration with the possibility of participanting for an extra prize, see our [2016 Competition](https://github.com/bitDubai/competition)

 
## Non-developers
=======

If you are not a developer or graphic designer, please refer to our [How to Participate Guide](https://github.com/bitDubai/participate-now).
